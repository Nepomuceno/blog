Changing a company culture it is something that takes time even for small companies imagine to change the culture of a company with more than 100,000 employees.

I have always been an admiror of Microsoft from the outside but this las week from inside Microsoft gave me the chance to admire even more the transformation and the doer culture that have been created inside the company.

<!-- more -->

Las week I was in the largest internal company hack in the world we had almost 25k hackers and more than 5,000 projects this numbers are not only astonishing but all the effortt and incentive that the company put in this it is increrdible.

My case exemply how it is the dedication of the company for this hack since I was not even supposed to be there.

We had another internal hack in UK where everyone from my department had 2 days in which they could get together to hack in a project they though was interesting the 2 projects that win were going to be selected to participate in the company wide hack and the team of this projects would be flew over to seattle to participate in the hack.

My team was not the winner but My coleague Ahamed had holidas schedule already and couldn't reschedule so he asked for me to go in his place to help the team. So the company flew me over with all expenses paid from London to Seattle so I could participate in a hack.
