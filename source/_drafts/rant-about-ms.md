title: Microsoft, A company of engineers?

## My background with Microsoft

When I joined Microsoft I had some things that were certain to me that were not to others.

I am not old enough to have a strong recollection of Microsoft from the Bill Gates era, I saw a lot of his legacy, but never saw he actually working for Microsoft what doesn't make me admire him due to the whole time that I have seen him in the foundation and through all the histories that I have heard from him, but my first impression from Microsoft comes from Steve Balmer.

I was never a big fan of sales or advertising I always believe on the saying

> Build and they will come.

Came as a surprise from me to see that Balmer was this sales guy because from the time that Balmer was heading Microsoft I remember two things clear in my mind, and both of them come from external conferences where he was speaking.

The first thing that I remember he said was: [Developers, Developers, Developers!](https://youtu.be/Vhh_GeBPOhs) This mantra that becomes a meme on the internet years later was for me in my early years of programming what would define Microsoft. I am a developer and Microsoft cares about me, they also do software so there was this empathy that I felt for the company. I thought Microsoft it is one of the largest companies in the word and it a company about developers I assumed that was a company of developers internally and externally.

The second thing that I remember Balmer saying actually became a meme too, years later, I remember he coming to the stage jumping up and down, coming to the microphone and saying: [I love this Company!](https://youtu.be/f__n8084YAE?t=13) that was it for me there was no better way for me to identify with a company, I saw a company that was not only about developers but about passion about passionate developers. That was exactly what I am someone that gets excited about building things about empowering people.

## Being a technical evangelist

I joined Microsoft as a technical evangelist. At first look, this title doesn't mean much but when you start to think about it, it actually joins the two things that I was first attracted to Microsoft because of. I would be still Technical and I would be passionate about it, the work I assumed was to get people passionate about Microsoft as I am. When there were the restructuring and my team was put under OCP on the Build-with Motion. I thought: "This is great it is exactly what I do a tech guy building with others".

How could I be so wrong? I forget to check which part of the organization I was under, I was under sales and marketing, and apparently being under sales and marketing has a much greater influence that being in the build with motion or being in a software company. When the things start to be more about having a good relationship more than having a good product, I can't see how this relates to our Mission to: ["Empower every person and every organization on the planet to achieve more."](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/about) I strongly believe in makers and those makers that actually push the world forward.

Today I find incongruous that we are the tech team in a build with motion focus on people that build software and we do not expect to be coders.

Of course, I find important that you should be able to draw an architecture diagram or to explain how to communicate with our products, and even how to reach out to people that would be able to help you, in the end, coding is a social activity. and building a product it is an even more social activity. If you are in the build with motion you should know how to build.

More than knowing how to build it is important to get excited about it. It is really easy to get excited about a finished product and many people do but I think it is important to be excited about the building process and if you are building software you need to be exciting about coding and about using technology and about the code that someone else wrote. You need to know how to get your hands dirty if you need too. 

If you can do that how are you going to be passing confidence, how are you going to be asking someone to be building with you if you are not excited about the building processes if you are not excited about the chance of you making things?

If you are in a rocket company it is not enough to love to see the rockets flying and going to space, you need to be passionate about how the combustion chamber works, get excited about a new closed combustion cycle that can speed fuel intake.

There is one anecdote that I like:

> let's say that you have 2 aeroplane manufacturer one that has mathematical tests and profs to be a strict part of the engineering and manufacturing part of each new aeroplane and strict check it, the other it is not that strict but all the engineers fly with the aeroplane on the first test flight. Which one would you feel more secure to fly in?

This explains a lot for me about the work that I thought was expected from a TE, it is about believing in the tools it is about have been using them it is about being able to put yourself on the developer sit. It is also about being able to put yourself on the CTO sit and even the CEO sit.

I love Satia and the work that he is doing and I think that he is taking Microsoft in the right direction transforming the company on being a company even more focused on engineering and he has been showing that day after day.

Then when I think about building with partners that are building software I can't stop thinking: Developers, Developers, Developers!
